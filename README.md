# Group project: quiz application

![Home Screen](./images/cover.png)

This is a **group project** I, alongside three other student developers, **built from scratch** during my Continuing Education course at **Toulouse Institute of Technology**.

This quiz application is designed to **help learn the rules of roller derby**, a fast-paced, highly strategical team sport I have been playing competitively for nearly ten years. It was **my idea to build this project**.

Due to **technical difficulties** some team members encountered during our three day long hackathon, this project is **not as functional** as we would have hoped. I was initally tasked with the "Correction" page, which was dependent on a struggling team member's component to be fully functional. When it became apparent that that teammate wouldn't be able to finish up their work in time for the presentation, I **consulted with the team** and **made the decision to take on the homepage**. It ended up being the focus of our end-of-hackathon presentation, **gaining praise for our web design**. I'm glad that I could use my ability to **think quick on my feet** and be **proactive** to reevaluate my priorities and switch my focus to something that would be **valuable to the team**!
